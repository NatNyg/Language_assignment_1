# Language_Assignment_1: Collocate tool
This is the repository for assignment 1 in Language Analytics. 

The code provides a collocation tool which then produces a result of a dataframe containing the name of each collocate within a window-range of 10 of a target word, how many times each collocate appears in the text (B), number of times each word inside the window accours with the target word (AB) and the MI (information score). The dataframe will be saved into the "out" folder. 

## Repository Structure 

The repository includes three folders: 
- in: this folder should contain the data that the code is run on
- out: this folder will contain the results after the code has been run
- src: this folder contains the code that has to be run to achieve the results
